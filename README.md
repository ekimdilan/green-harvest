# ü•ï Green Harvest ‚Äî Code Club Team Project  

> A collaborative front-end project built as part of **Code Club**, focusing on creating a modern, responsive and user-friendly web experience that connects users with locally-sourced fresh produce.

## üå± Overview  

**Green Harvest** is a front-end web project developed in a team setting during the GoIT FullStack Web Developer program.  
Our goal was to design and build a **mobile-first responsive website** that promotes sustainable eating habits and makes ordering fresh local produce simple and enjoyable.  

What started as a design concept turned into a fully-functional, styled website with interactive form handling and modern UI/UX principles.  
Working collaboratively helped us strengthen not only our coding skills but also our teamwork, problem-solving and presentation abilities.
